##EventBus use case : Chat

This is a small example, inspired from [vertx-web chat example] (https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-examples/tree/master/web-examples/src/main/java/io/vertx/example/web/chat).

The example shows you how it is possible to use the realtime caracteristic of the event bus to create a chat.

### How can you run it ?

You just need to run it like all the other examples with **gradlew start**, and then you have to go to this url :
*localhost:8080* to chat :)

You can try opening several clients to simulate a discussion, and see that this works well :)
