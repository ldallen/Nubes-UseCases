##Authentication use case with JWT

This is a small example which shows how you can protect a route using `JWT` authentication system in Vertx-Nubes.  

Inspired from [vertx-web examples](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-examples/tree/master/web-examples/src/main/java/io/vertx/example/web/jwt) and adapted for Nubes.
