##Authentication use case with JDBC

This example show how easy it is to add an authentication system to your Nubes app.

The base of this example is the Todo-List example but with a real jdbc database. (use both for the users information and the tasks table).

In this example, you can also see a real use case of the EventBus required authorities (only admin users can add/del tasks).
