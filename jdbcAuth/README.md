##Authentication use case with JDBC

This example shows how easy it is to add an authentication system to your Nubes application.

This example is an extension of the todolist example, using a real jdbc database. The database is used both for the users information and the tasks table.

In this example, you can also see a real use case of the EventBus required authorities (only admin users are allowed to add/delete tasks).
